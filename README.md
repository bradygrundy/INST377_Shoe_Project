Description : This repository contains the HTML file, SQL build script, PHP file, and CSS styling sheet for 
a website that allows a user to choose their desired style of sneaker, and see a list of prices for that 
style across different popular shoe vendors such as Zappos and Dick’s Sporting Goods. When the user clicks
on a specific price, it will redirect them to the company’s website so that they can purchase the shoe.
